# Shopping Centre Interactive Sign

 An interactive sign system for a fictional shopping centre made with .Net Maui. This was for an assignment at College, where the goal was to create an accessible user interface following HCI principles. The app uses a local database to display content.
 Not everything in this app may function as intended, as this is my first app. The quality of code may not be perfect either, however this will improve with time.
